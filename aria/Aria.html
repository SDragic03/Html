ARIA - Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications
A specification created to help bring accessibility and semantic value to more modern web
applications that rely on AJAX, HTML, and JavaScript

Without ARIA assistive technologies cannot recognize complex controls, gloss over elements
as content and not functionality, providing no additional feedback to the user, rendering
them completely inaccessible

With ARIA items become widgets that can be interpreted by assistive technologies allowing
the user to interact with them.

It is best practice to use the Default HTML elements if possible.
Don't create your own custom control if it will have the same functionality of a native
HTML element.

ARIA attributes are designed to be used by the operating systems accessibility API so
that assistive technologies will interpret the widgets in the same way they would a
native app control

ARIA specification splits things up into two different categories:

Roles: What a widget is or what it does
    They are used for things like menus, sliders, progress meters, Modals, etc
    They are used to describe structure, like headings, regions, tables

    Landmark roles: special type of ARIA role that help assistive technologies navigate
    our content. They are used to describe common regions within documents. To add them to
    markup we add a role attribute to the container element with the proper name.

        role="application"
            Used if the region is considered a web application and not a web document.
            This will let any assistive technology know that it should switch into application
            browsing mode which make navigation much quicker since the user will now navigate
            from widget to widget instead of links and form controls.

        role="banner"
            Normally the header of the site or application, contains name of the site
            and the title of the page

        role="navigation"
            Contains navigation for the site or application

        role="main"
            Should be added to the container that contains the main content for the document

        role="search"
            Should be added to the search form for the site or application

        role="complimentary"
            Used to contain content that's complimentary to the main content for the document
            usually found on items like side bars.

        role="form"
            Should be added to anything that contains a collection of elements that make up a form.

        role="contentinfo"
            Normally used for things like the site footer, providing information about the parent
            document, like footnotes, copyrights, and privacy statements.

    Widgets roles: roles that are used to describe interactive elements that currently have no HTML counterpart
        Examples: alert, button, checkbox, gridcell, link, log, menuitem, progressbar, scrollbar, etc

    Container roles: subset of widget roles that can be used as containers for other contained widgets
        Examples: combobox, grid, listbox, menu, menubar, radiogroup, tablist, tree, treegrid, etc

    Document Structure roles: roles used for to describle non-interactive elements that provide the
    structure of content within your site or applications.
        Examples: article, columnheader, directory, heading, img, list, listitem, row, toolbar, etc

States & Properties: aka ARIA attributes

    States: The current interaction state of a widget:
        These attributes describe dynamic states of custom components
        state attributes are normally updated with JavaScript when they need to change
        state attributes are perfixed with aria-

            Examples:
            aria-busy: is an aria state attribute that should be used on auto updating content
            aria-disabled: is an aria state attribute that indicates that a form field is disabled
            aria-expanded: is an aria state attribute used to indicate the state of a collapsible element
            aria-haspopup: is an aria state attribute used to indicate that the element has a popup context menu or sub-level menu.
            aria-hidden: is an aria state attribute used to indicate that the element and all of its descendants are not visible or perceivable to any user

    Properties: Characteristics of the widgets:
        They are used to describe relationships between elements and rarely change
        Property attributes are perfixed with aria-

        Examples:
        aria-label: is an aria property attribute that is used to define a string that labels the current element.
        aria-labelledby: is an aria property that provides the user with a recognizable name of the object.
