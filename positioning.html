            Each of us has read somewhere that in New Guinea pidgin the word for 'piano' is (I use English spelling)
            'this fellow you hit teeth belonging to him he squeal all same pig'.
            I am inclined to doubt whether this expression is authentic; it looks just like the kind of thing a visitor
            to the Islands would facetiously invent.
            But I accept 'cut grass belong head belong me' for 'haircut' as genuine...
            Such phrases seem very funny to us, and make us feel very superior to the ignorant foreigners who use long
            winded expressions for simple matters.
            And then it is our turn to name quite a simple thing,
            a small uncomplicated molecule consisting of nothing more than a measly 11 carbons,
            seven hydrogens, one nitrogen and six oxygens.
            We sharpen our pencils, consult our rule books and at last come up with 3-[(1, 3- dihydro-1,
            3-dioxo-2H-isoindol-2-yl) oxy]-3-oxopropanoic acid.
            A name like that could drive any self-respecting Papuan to piano-playing.

            In “Atomic War or Peace,” Albert Einstein wrote:
            “The release of atomic energy has not created anew problem. It has merely made more urgent the necessity of solving an existing one.
            “One could say that it has affected us quantitatively, not qualitatively. As long as there are sovereign nations possessing great power, war is inevitable.
            “That is not an attempt to say when it will come,but only that it is sure to come. That was true before the atomic bomb was made. What has been changed is the destructiveness of war.”

        <p>“The madman’s explanation of a thing is always complete, and often in a purely rational sense satisfactory.
            Or, to speak more strictly, the insane explanation, if not conclusive,
            is at least unanswerable; this may be observed specially in the two or three commonest kinds of madness.
            If a man says (for instance) that men have a conspiracy against him,
            you cannot dispute it except by saying that all the men deny that they are conspirators; which is exactly what conspirators would do.
            His explanation covers the facts as much as yours . . .
            “Every one who has had the misfortune to talk with people in the heart or on the edge of mental disorder,
            knows that their most sinister quality is a horrible clarity of detail;
            a connecting of one thing with another in a map more elaborate than a maze.
            If you argue with a madman, it is extremely probable that you will get the worst of it;
            for in many ways his mind moves all the quicker for not being delayed by the things that go with good judgment.
            He is not hampered by a sense of humour or by charity, or by the dumb certainties of experience.
            He is the more logical for losing certain sane affections. Indeed, the common phrase for insanity is in this respect a misleading one.
            The madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason.”</p>
